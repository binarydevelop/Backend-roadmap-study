# Proxy Authentication:

Proxy Authentication, as the name suggests, is used for authentication between a client and an intermediary proxy server.
In some network architectures, client devices may communicate with web servers through proxy servers. Proxy Authentication allows the proxy server to authenticate the client.
It uses similar mechanisms as Digest Authentication, where the proxy server sends a challenge to the client, and the client responds with a hash of credentials.
The proxy server then verifies the hash to authenticate the client.
Proxy Authentication ensures that only authorized clients can use a proxy server to access web resources.
