# Basics of Routing

## Router 
Router is basically a newtwork device that forwards traffic depending on the destination address of that traffic. A router has at least two network interfaces since it has to be connected to two network devices to do its job. 

Basic Routing looks like:

Routing is a process that is performed by layer 3 (or network layer) devices in order to deliver the packet by choosing an optimal path from one network to another. 

There are 3 types of routing: 

1. Static Routing: Static routing is a process in which we have to manually add routes to the routing table. 
2. Default Routing: This is the method where the router is configured to send all packets toward a single router (next hop). It doesnâ€™t matter to which network the packet belongs, it is forwarded out to the router which is configured for default routing. It is generally used with stub routers. A stub router is a router that has only one route to reach all other networks. 
3. Dynamic Routing: Dynamic routing makes automatic adjustments of the routes according to the current state of the route in the routing table. Dynamic routing uses protocols to discover network destinations and the routes to reach them. RIP and OSPF are the best examples of dynamic routing protocols. Automatic adjustments will be made to reach the network destination if one route goes down. 

A dynamic protocol has the following features: 

The routers should have the same dynamic protocol running in order to exchange routes. 
When a router finds a change in the topology then the router advertises it to all other routers.
