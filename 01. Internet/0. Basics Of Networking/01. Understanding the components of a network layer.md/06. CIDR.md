# CIDR

Classless Inter domain routing. Idea of CIDR is based on both classful addressing and subnetting. It's basically an improvement over classful addressing using the concept of subnetting. 

## Problems with classful addressing 

since we have 24 bits in class A to represent host id we will have 2 to the power of 24 hosts in class A and similarly 2 to the power of 16 and 2 to the power of 8 in class B and Class C respectively. So if someone wants 1 million ip addresses he will have to buy to a newtork with 15 million more ip addresses and that going in waste. 

To remove these problems CIDR was introduced. CIDR uses the idea of boundaries in bits.  

CIDR is based on the idea that IP addresses can be allocated and routed based on their network prefix rather than their class, which was the traditional way of IP address allocation.

CIDR addresses are represented using a slash notation, which specifies the number of bits in the network prefix. For example, an IP address of 192.168.1.0 with a prefix length of 24 would be represented as 192.168.1.0/24. This notation indicates that the first 24 bits of the IP address are the network prefix and the remaining 8 bits are the host identifier.

**Representation**: It is as also a 32-bit address, which includes a special number that represents the number of bits that are present in the Block Id or network id .
```
 a . b . c . d / n 
```
Where n is the number of bits that are present in Block Id / Network Id. Example:
```
20.10.50.100/20 
```

Rules for forming CIDR Blocks:

- All IP addresses must be contiguous.
- Block size must be the power of 2 (2n). If the size of the block is the power of 2, then it will be easy to divide the Network. Finding out the Block Id is very easy if the block size is of the power of 2. Example: If the Block size is 25 then, Host Id will contain 5 bits and Network will contain 32 â€“ 5 = 27 bits. 
Size of the block is the total number of IP Addresses contained in the block.
- First IP address of the Block must be evenly divisible by the size of the block. in simple words, the least significant part should always start with zeroes in Host Id. Since all the least significant bits of Host Id is zero, then we can use it as Block Id part.
Example: Check whether 100.1.2.32 to 100.1.2.47 is a valid IP address block or not?

All the IP addresses are contiguous.
Total number of IP addresses in the Block = 16 = 24.
1st IP address: 100.1.2.00100000 Since, Host Id will contains last 4 bits and all the least significant 4 bits are zero. Hence, first IP address is evenly divisible by the size of the block.
All three rules are followed by this Block. Hence, it is a valid IP address block.


### REMEMBER
```

If any binary pattern consisting of (m + n) bits is divided by 2n, then-

Remainder is least significant n bits
Quotient is most significant m bits
 

So, any binary pattern is divisible by 2n, if and only if its least significant n bits are 0.

 

Examples-
 

Consider a binary pattern-

01100100.00000001.00000010.01000000

(represented as 100.1.2.64)

It is divisible by 25 since its least significant 5 bits are zero.
It is divisible by 26 since its least significant 6 bits are zero.
It is not divisible by 27 since its least significant 7 bits are not zero.
