# IP address class system 

Ip address can be split into two sections: the network Id and the host ID.

Example: 

```
9.100.100.100

9 would be the network ID First octet
100.100.100 the last three octets define Host Id

```

## Address class system
Address class system is a way of defining how the global IP address is split up. 
There are primarily three classes of an address system. A, B and C.

- class A addresses are those where the first octet is used for the network ID and the last three for Host Id. 
- class B addresses are those where the first two octets are used for the network Id and and the last two for Host Id. 
- class C addresses are those where the first three octets are used for the network Id and and the last one for Host Id.
