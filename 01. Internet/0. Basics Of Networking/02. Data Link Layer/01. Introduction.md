# The Data Link Layer
The Data Link Layer is the second last layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, which is a conceptual framework used to understand how different networking protocols interact within a networked system. The Data Link Layer is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between two directly connected nodes over a physical link. Its main functions include:

* Data Link layer is handled by the NIC (Network Interface Card) and device drivers of host machines. It is implemented in NIC 
  which has a fixed 48 bit MAC address so DLL works on this MAC address called Ethernet address. 
* Switch & Bridge are Data Link Layer devices.
* In wifi collision detection is handled by CSMA/CA and in ethernet by CSMA/CD. Carrier sense multiple access. 
* Packet recieved from network layer consists of source and destination IP address which is then converted to MAC addresses by data  link layer

1. **Framing:** The Data Link Layer breaks down the data received from the upper layer into smaller units called frames. Each frame consists of a header (containing control information) and a trailer (used for error checking). It also adds a Flag for the destination to know that a new frame has begun since below this layer is physical layer which transmits 0's and 1's so in order to differentiate frames framing is used This can be done in two ways: 
    1. Byte stuffing: a flag is added at the beginning of the packet or it can be added in packet as well but with a esc character.
```
---------------------------------
Flag | Header | Packet | Trailer |
---------------------------------
```

    2. Bit stuffing: Bit as a pattern is added so whenever the recieving point sees this pattern it handles the incoming data as new frame. 

2. **Physical Addressing:** Every device on a network has a unique hardware address, also known as a MAC (Media Access Control) address. The Data Link Layer uses MAC addresses to identify source and destination devices in a network.

3. **Flow Control:** Flow control mechanisms ensure that data transmission occurs at a pace that the receiving device can handle. This prevents the receiver from being overwhelmed with data and helps in maintaining efficient communication.

4. **Error Detection and Correction:** The Data Link Layer detects errors that might occur during data transmission and attempts to correct them. It uses techniques like cyclic redundancy check (CRC), Parity and checksums to identify errors in received frames. and for correcting those errors we use algorithms like stop & wait, go back n, selective repeat. All are variations of a single standard algorithm called Sliding window. Together all these are called ARQ automatic repeat request. 

5. **Media Access Control (MAC):** The MAC sublayer of the Data Link Layer is responsible for managing access to the physical transmission medium in shared network topologies. It implements protocols for avoiding data collisions among devices sharing the same medium.

6. **Logical Link Control (LLC):** The LLC sublayer of the Data Link Layer handles flow control, error checking, and manages link management functions. It serves as an interface between the Data Link Layer and the Network Layer above it.

7. **Frame Delimitation and Synchronization:** The Data Link Layer ensures that the receiver can synchronize its clock with the sender's clock by embedding synchronization patterns within the frame.

8. **Frame Addressing and Control:** Each frame includes control information that specifies whether it is a data frame, acknowledgment, or control frame. This information helps in managing the flow of data and maintaining the integrity of the communication.

9. **Media Arbitration:** In networks where multiple devices share a common communication medium (like Ethernet), the Data Link Layer handles mechanisms for deciding which device can transmit data at a given time to avoid collisions.

Overall, the Data Link Layer plays a crucial role in ensuring reliable point-to-point and point-to-multipoint data communication within a network. It acts as an interface between the physical hardware and higher-level network protocols, enabling efficient and error-free data transfer.

* The Data link layer creates a unit called Frame which is created by attaching headers and trailers on a packet. Headers contain source and destination MAC addresses whereas trailer contains the checksum and error checking.
