# Address Resolution Protocol
ARP is used to find MAC address or LAN address of a device with a given IP Address. 

MAC addresses and IP addresses serve different purposes in computer networking and are used at different layers of the network stack.

MAC addresses (Media Access Control) are used at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the networking model. They are unique identifiers assigned to network interfaces, such as network interface cards (NICs) or network adapters. MAC addresses are hard-coded into the hardware by the manufacturer and provide a globally unique identification for each device on a network. MAC addresses are used for local network communication and are only relevant within the same local network segment or broadcast domain. They are primarily used for addressing and delivery of data at the link layer, facilitating the transmission of Ethernet frames between devices within a local network. MAC addresses are essential for functions such as Ethernet switching, where frames are forwarded based on MAC addresses, and for protocols like Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) that map IP addresses to MAC addresses.

On the other hand, IP addresses (Internet Protocol) are used at the network layer (Layer 3) of the networking model. IP addresses are numerical identifiers assigned to devices connected to a network. They provide a logical address that identifies the location of a device on a network. IP addresses are used for routing data between networks and enable communication between devices across different networks. They are globally unique within the scope of the internet or a private network. IP addresses are used by protocols like Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) or Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) to identify source and destination devices and to direct data packets across networks. IP addresses are essential for functions such as routing, where routers use IP addresses to determine the next hop for forwarding packets, and for higher-level protocols like TCP or UDP, which rely on IP addresses to establish connections and deliver data.

In summary, MAC addresses are used for addressing and delivery of data within a local network at the data link layer, while IP addresses are used for identifying devices and routing data across networks at the network layer. MAC addresses are relevant only within a local network segment, whereas IP addresses are used for communication across different networks, including the internet.

They can be ralated to use other with a protocol known as Address Resolution Protocol comes into play. A protocol used to discover the hardware(MAC) address of a node with a certain IP address. once an IP datagram is if fully formed it needs to be encapsulated inside an ethernet frame, this means that the transmitting device needs a destination MAC address to complete the ethernet header. Almost all network connected devices will retian a local ARP table. An ARP table is list of IP addresses and the MAC addresses associated with them. 

When an IP is not found in the LOCAL ARP table it sends an ARP broadcast to all devices connected in the network and the node with the inteded broadcast sends an ARP response back.

ARP tables generally expire with time to ensure changes in the network are accounted for.
