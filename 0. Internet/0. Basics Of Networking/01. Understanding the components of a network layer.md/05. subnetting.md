# Subnetting

The process of taking a larger network and splitting it up into many individual and smaller subnetworks or subnets.

If we want to communicate to an ip address say 9.100.100.100 the core routers on the internet knows that it belongs to the ip 9.0.0.0 class A network. They then route to the gateway router responsible for the network by looking at the network Id. A getway router essentially serves as an entry and exit path to a certain network. 

Once the packet gets to the gateway routers for the 9.0.0.0 class A network that router is now responsible for getting tht data to the proper system by looking at the host Id. the class A router will then have 16 million devices to connect to. This is where subnetting comes in.

With subnets we can split our large networks into many smaller ones. These individual subnets will have their own gateway routers serving as the ingresand egres point for each subnet.

## Subnet Masks

- Subnet Id: We know that an IP consist of Host Id and network Id. In the world of subnetting some bits that would normally comprise host id are actually used for the subnet Id 
```
                        10.0.1.10
                        |___|_|_|
                Network Id   \   \-------\
                            Subnet Id    Host Id
```
