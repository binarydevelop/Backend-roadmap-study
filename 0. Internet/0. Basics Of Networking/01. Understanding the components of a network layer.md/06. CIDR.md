# CIDR

Classless Inter domain routing. Idea of CIDR is based on both classful addressing and subnetting. It's basically an improvement over classful addressing using the concept of subnetting. 

## Problems with classful addressing 

since we have 24 bits in class A to represent host id we will have 2 to the power of 24 hosts in class A and similarly 2 to the power of 16 and 2 to the power of 8 in class B and Class C respectively. So if someone wants 1 million ip addresses he will have to buy to a newtork with 15 million more ip addresses and that going in waste. 

To remove these problems CIDR was introduced. CIDR uses the idea of boundaries in bits.  

CIDR is based on the idea that IP addresses can be allocated and routed based on their network prefix rather than their class, which was the traditional way of IP address allocation.

CIDR addresses are represented using a slash notation, which specifies the number of bits in the network prefix. For example, an IP address of 192.168.1.0 with a prefix length of 24 would be represented as 192.168.1.0/24. This notation indicates that the first 24 bits of the IP address are the network prefix and the remaining 8 bits are the host identifier.
