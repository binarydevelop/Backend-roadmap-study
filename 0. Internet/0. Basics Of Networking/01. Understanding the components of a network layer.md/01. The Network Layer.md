## Ip address

Ip addresses are 32 bit long numbers made of 4 octets, and each octet is decscribed using decimal numbers. 
This is known as dotted decimal notation. 
Ip addresses are distributed to large vendors and companies instead of vendors detrmining it. 
IBM owns every single IP address that has 9 in its first octet.

Ip addresses belong to the network not to the devices attached to the networks. 
This means that a laptop will have different Ip addresses at an internet cafe and it would at home. 
The LAN at a specific place will be responsible for handing out an IP address to the device. 

On any device we connect an IP will be assigned to it through a protoocl called DHCP. Dynamic Host Control Protocol. 
An Ip address assigned this way is known as dynamic Ip address. Opposite of this is static IP address which must be configured on a device or node manually. 

In most cases static Ip addresses are reserved for servers and network devices while dynamic IP addresses are reserved for clients.
