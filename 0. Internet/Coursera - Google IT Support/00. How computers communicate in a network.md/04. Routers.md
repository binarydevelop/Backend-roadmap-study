# Routers 

Hubs and switches are primarily used to connect computers on a single network, usually referred to as a LAN, or local area network. 
But we often want to send and recieve data on other networks, this is where router comes into play. 

A router is a device that knows how to forward data between independent networks. 
A router operates at layer 3 or the Network layer. A router can inspect IP data to determine where to send data. 
Routers have internal tables containg information about how to route traffics on different netwroks all over the world. The purpose of the router at home and offices is to take the traffic originating from home or office LAN [These do not have detailed routing tables] and to forward it along ISP or Internet service provider. Once at ISP a way more spohisticated router takes over these. Core router forms the backbone of the internet and are directly responsible for how we send and recieve data all over the internet every single day. 

The core routers have complex task to determine where to send data, these routers are connected to other routers, Routers share data via a protocol known as BGP Border Gateway Protocol which lets them learn about the most optimal paths to forward traffic.
