# Hubs and Switches

Cables allow to form to point to point networking connections these are device where single device exist at each end.
But there are many devices which allow for many computers to connect together. 

Hub : A physical layer device that allows for connections from many computers at once. A device connected to a hub will allow communication to all devices at once. Its upto the each system connected to the hub to determine if incoming data was meant for them or to ignore it. 
This causes a lot of noise on the network and causes what is called Collision Domain. 

A network segment where only one device can communicate at a time. If multiple systems try sending data at the same time electrical pulses sent across the cable can interfere with each other.This causes the systems to wait for a required period
before sending before they try sending the data again. It really slows down network communication. 

Now days more sophisticated device known as Network switch is used originally known as switching hub. 
A switch is similar to a hub but with a difference Hub is a physical layer 1 device but a switch is Data Link device 2. 

This means that the switch can actually inspect the content of etheenet protocol data determing which system is data inteded for and then send the data to only that device. This prevents or completely eliminates the size of collision domains on a network.
