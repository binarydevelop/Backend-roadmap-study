# Twisted Pair cabling and Duplexing. 

The most common way of cabling used to connect computer devices is known as twisted pair cable. It's called twisted pair cable because it features pair of copper wires twisted together. These pairs act as a single coduit for information and their twisted nature help protect from electromagnetic interference and crosstalk from neighbouring pairs. 

A standard Cat6 cable has 8 wires consisting of four twisted pairs inside a single jacket. Exactly how many pairs are actually in use depends upon the transmission technology being used. But all modern cables allow for duplex communication. 

A duplex communication is the concept that information can flow in both directions across the cable. 
On the flip side simplex communication is a concept that flow of information is unidirectional. 

The cables make sure that duplex communication is happening is by reserving one or two pairs for communicating in one direction and the other one or two pair to communicate in other direction.

The two devices communicating with each other at the same time is known as Full-duplex communication, whereas half-duplex is when 
communication can happen in both directions but one side can send information at a time.
