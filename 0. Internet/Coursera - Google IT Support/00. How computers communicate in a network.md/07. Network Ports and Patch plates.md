# Network Ports and Patch Plates

The final steps of how the physical layer works takes place at the endpoint of our network links. Twisted pair cables are terminated with a plug that takes the individual internal wires and exposes them.The most common plug is known as RJ45 or Register Jack 45. It's one of many plug cable specification but by far the most common in networking. 

In a network cable with the RJ45 plug can connect to an RJ45 network port. Network ports are generally attached to a device that generally makes up a computer network. Switches would have many network ports because their purpose is to connect many devices. But servers and desktops usually have one or two. 

Network ports have two lights one is the Link light and other is the activity light. 
Link Led when a cable is connected to two devices and are turned on,
The activity light will flash when data is actively transmitted across the cables.

Sometimes the network ports can be mounted on a wall these ports are connected to the network via cables ran through a wall that eventually end at a patch panel. 

A patch panel is a device containg many different ports but it does no other work. It's just the container for the endpoints of many runs of the cable. Additional cables are then genrally ran from a patch panel to switches or routers to provide network access to the computers at the other end of those links.
