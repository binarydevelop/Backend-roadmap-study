# Cables 

Lots of cables can be used to allow computers to communicate with each other. 

Most basic component of a wired network to transmit data is known as cables. Cables connect different devices to each other allowing data to be transmitted over them. 

Most cables used today can be split into two types: 
1. Copper 
2. Fibre

Copper cables are the most common form of netwroking cable. They are made of copper wires inside plastic insulators. 
Computers communicate in binary which humans represent as 0 and 1's . The sending device sends this binary data across this copper wires by changing voltage between two ranges , the system at the recieving end is able to interpret these voltage changes as 1's and 0 which can then be translated into different forms of data. 

The most common forms of copper twisted-pair cables used in networking are Cat5, Cat5e and Cat6 cables.These are all ways of sayng category 5 and category 6 cables. All categories have different physical characteristics like number of twists in the wire.

Cat 5 has mostly been replaced by Cat5e and Cat6 cables mostly because of Crosstalks. Crosstalk is when an electrical pulse on one wire is accidentally detected on another wire. 

The second form of netwrokng cable is known as Fiber short for Fiber Optic cables. Contain individual optical fibres which are tiny tubes made out of glass about the width of a human hair. 

Unlike copper cables which uses electrical voltages fibres uses pulses of light to represent the 1 and 0's.
