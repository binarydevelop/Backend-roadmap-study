# Differences between TCP & UDP.md

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two different transport layer protocols within the TCP/IP networking model. They serve distinct purposes and have different characteristics, making them suitable for different types of applications and scenarios. Here are the key differences between TCP and UDP:

1. **Connection-Oriented vs. Connectionless:**
   - TCP: Connection-oriented protocol. It establishes a connection between sender and receiver before data transmission begins.
   - UDP: Connectionless protocol. Each datagram (packet) is sent independently without establishing a connection.

2. **Reliability:**
   - TCP: Provides reliable data transfer. Uses acknowledgments (ACKs) and retransmissions to ensure all data is delivered accurately, in order, and without loss or duplication.
   - UDP: Does not guarantee reliable delivery. Packets may be lost, duplicated, or delivered out of order.

3. **Error Detection and Correction:**
   - TCP: Performs error checking and correction using checksums. Corrupted segments are discarded, and the sender is notified to retransmit them.
   - UDP: Performs basic error detection using checksums. Corrupted datagrams are often discarded, but the receiver doesn't request retransmissions.

4. **Flow Control:**
   - TCP: Implements flow control mechanisms to prevent sender from overwhelming receiver. Uses sliding window and window size to regulate data flow.
   - UDP: No built-in flow control. Sender can transmit data as quickly as it wants, potentially causing congestion.

5. **Ordered Data Delivery:**
   - TCP: Guarantees ordered delivery of data. Uses sequence numbers to ensure data is delivered in the same order it was sent.
   - UDP: No guaranteed ordered delivery. Packets may arrive out of order, and application must reorder if necessary.

6. **Latency and Overhead:**
   - TCP: Higher latency due to connection establishment, acknowledgments, and error checking. More overhead due to additional header information.
   - UDP: Lower latency due to lack of connection establishment and minimal header. Lower overhead makes it suitable for real-time applications.

7. **Applications and Use Cases:**
   - TCP: Suitable for applications requiring reliable, accurate, and ordered data transfer, such as web browsing, email, file transfer, and databases.
   - UDP: Suitable for applications prioritizing speed and low latency, such as online gaming, streaming media, VoIP, DNS, and network monitoring.

8. **Header Size:**
   - TCP: Larger header size due to additional control information for reliable communication.
   - UDP: Smaller header size, resulting in less overhead.

9. **Example Protocols:**
   - TCP: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, SSH
   - UDP: DNS, DHCP, SNMP, VoIP (Voice over IP), online gaming

In summary, TCP offers reliable, ordered, and error-checked data transfer with higher overhead and latency. UDP offers connectionless, lightweight, and faster communication with the trade-off of potential data loss and lack of reliability. The choice between TCP and UDP depends on the specific requirements of the application and the importance of factors such as data integrity, speed, and latency.
