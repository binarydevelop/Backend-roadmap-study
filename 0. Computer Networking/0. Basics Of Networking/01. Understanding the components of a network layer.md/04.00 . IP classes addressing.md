# IP Classes and addressing

IPV4 Addresses can be represented in two ways either in decimal notation or in binary notation. 
These are 32- bit long numbers organized into 4 octets. Every octet is simply 8 bits.

How do we know that 0-127 is class A?

Because we know that first byte or the first octet has to be 0 for class A , 10 for class B, 110 for class C, 1110 for class D and 1111 for class E.

Now if we try to make a table The first and the last bytes can be between 0 -255
so if we do 0000000 - 01111111
thats 0 - 127 
similarly if we have for class B the first two bits of the first octet need to be 10 so it should be 10000000 - 10111111 
which corresponds to 128 - 191 

and so on.
