# Network Layer 

This is called network layer when we talk about it in the OSI model and Ip layer when we talk in context of TCP/IP model. 

In transport layer we have TCP, UDP. In data link layer we have wifi and ethernet protocols but this layer has one dominating protocol known as the IP protocol.  

The network layer is a crucial component of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model and the TCP/IP protocol suite. It plays a fundamental role in computer networking by facilitating communication between devices on different networks. The primary device used at the network layer is a router. Let's delve into the network layer, its functions, and how routers are used within it.

**Network Layer Functions:**
The network layer is responsible for routing data packets across different networks. Its main functions include:

1. **Routing:** Determining the best path for data packets to travel from the source to the destination across interconnected networks.

2. **Logical Addressing:** Assigning logical addresses (such as IP addresses in the case of TCP/IP) to devices on the network, allowing them to be uniquely identified.

3. **Fragmentation and Reassembly:** Breaking large data packets into smaller fragments that can be transmitted across networks with varying Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs) and reassembling them at the destination.

4. **Error Handling and Packet Forwarding:** Detecting errors in data packets and making decisions about forwarding them to the appropriate next-hop routers.

5. **Tunneling:** Encapsulating packets from one network protocol within packets of another network protocol, allowing data to traverse networks that use different protocols.

**Routers and Their Role in the Network Layer:**
Routers are specialized devices that operate at the network layer. They play a vital role in the functioning of the Internet and other large-scale networks. Here's how routers are used within the network layer:

1. **Packet Forwarding:** Routers receive data packets from devices within their local network or from other routers. They examine the packet's destination IP address to determine the best path for forwarding the packet toward its destination.

2. **Routing Decisions:** Routers make routing decisions based on the routing table they maintain. The routing table contains information about various routes, including the associated network addresses, next-hop routers, and associated metrics (such as link cost or hop count).

3. **Address Translation:** Routers often perform Network Address Translation (NAT) to allow multiple devices within a local network to share a single public IP address when communicating with external networks.

4. **Path Selection:** Routers use routing algorithms to select the optimal path for each packet. These algorithms consider factors like link cost, network congestion, and routing policies.

5. **Packet Switching:** Routers switch packets between different interfaces based on the destination IP address. They make decisions about whether to forward packets through their local interfaces or to other routers.

6. **Interconnecting Networks:** Routers serve as the backbone of the Internet by interconnecting various networks. They ensure that data packets traverse the most efficient paths across multiple networks to reach their destinations.

7. **Error Handling:** Routers detect errors in packets and make decisions about whether to drop, forward, or correct the packets. They also handle congestion by employing flow control mechanisms.

8. **Packet Fragmentation and Reassembly:** If a packet's size exceeds the MTU of a link, routers may fragment the packet into smaller units and reassemble them at the destination.

In essence, routers in the network layer are responsible for making intelligent decisions about routing data packets across complex interconnected networks. They ensure that data reaches its intended destination efficiently, even when dealing with diverse networks and varying link conditions.

## Packet Switching
 Packet switching is a fundamental concept in computer networking and telecommunications, used to transmit data efficiently across networks. It contrasts with circuit switching, where a dedicated communication path is established between the sender and receiver for the duration of the conversation. In packet switching, data is divided into smaller units called packets, which are then transmitted independently across the network. This approach offers several advantages, including improved efficiency, flexibility, and robustness.

Here's how packet switching works:

Packetization: The data to be transmitted is divided into smaller packets. Each packet typically contains a portion of the original data, along with headers that provide information about the packet's source, destination, and its position within the sequence of packets.

Routing: When a packet enters the network, routers examine its destination address to determine the best path for the packet to reach its destination. These routers make routing decisions based on the current network conditions, such as traffic load and link availability. The goal is to efficiently route the packet through the network to its destination.

Transmission: Each packet is transmitted individually across the network. As packets travel from one router to another, they might take different routes based on current network conditions. This dynamic routing allows the network to adapt to changes and avoid congestion.

Reassembly: At the receiving end, the packets are collected and reassembled into their original order using the sequence information stored in the packet headers. Once all packets have been received and reassembled, the original data is reconstructed.

Acknowledgments and Error Handling: To ensure reliable communication, some packet-switching protocols require acknowledgments. When a receiver receives a packet, it sends an acknowledgment back to the sender. If the sender doesn't receive an acknowledgment within a specified time frame, it assumes the packet was lost and retransmits it. Additionally, error detection and correction mechanisms are often employed to ensure the integrity of the transmitted data.

Quality of Service (QoS): Packet switching allows for different types of traffic to share the same network infrastructure. QoS mechanisms prioritize certain types of packets, such as real-time voice or video, over less time-sensitive data like email. This ensures that critical applications receive the necessary network resources to function smoothly.

Packet switching is the foundation of modern data communication networks, including the Internet. It enables efficient utilization of network resources by dynamically adapting to changing traffic patterns and network conditions. By dividing data into packets and routing them independently, packet switching has revolutionized the way information is transmitted, making communication faster, more flexible, and more resilient.

## Circuit Switching

Circuit switching is another communication technique, contrasting with packet switching. It involves the creation of a dedicated communication path, or "circuit," between the sender and the receiver for the duration of a conversation. This path remains open and reserved exclusively for that conversation, even if no data is being transmitted.

Here's how circuit switching works:

1. Connection Establishment: When a user initiates a call or communication session, the network sets up a dedicated path (circuit) between the sender and the receiver. This path remains open for the entire duration of the conversation.

2. Data Transmission: Once the circuit is established, data transmission begins. Both parties can send data back and forth without having to deal with routing decisions or other participants' traffic. This leads to consistent and predictable communication quality, as the allocated resources are exclusive to the conversation.

3. Real-time Communication: Circuit switching is often used for real-time communication, such as telephone calls. The dedicated circuit ensures low latency and a steady flow of data, which is crucial for maintaining the natural flow of conversation.

4. Connection Termination: When the conversation is completed or one of the parties hangs up, the dedicated circuit is released. The resources that were allocated for the circuit are now available for other communications.
