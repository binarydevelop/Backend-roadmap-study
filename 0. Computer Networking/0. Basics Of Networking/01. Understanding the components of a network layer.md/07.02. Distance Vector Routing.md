# Distance Vector Routing 
It is based on Bellman-Ford Algorithm. 
Distance Vector Routing is a routing algorithm used in computer networks to determine the best path for data packets to travel from a source node to a destination node. It operates based on the idea of exchanging routing information between neighboring routers to build and update routing tables. Each router maintains a table that contains information about the distance (or cost) to reach other nodes in the network and the next-hop router that should be used to forward packets towards those nodes.

Here's a simple explanation of Distance Vector Routing with an example:

Imagine you have a network of four routers: A, B, C, and D. Each router wants to find the best path to reach all the other routers in the network. The distances can represent various metrics like hop count, latency, bandwidth, etc.

Initial setup:
- Router A knows its own neighbors (B and C) and their distances (e.g., B is 1 unit away and C is 3 units away).
- Router A doesn't know about routers D initially.

Similarly, other routers have their initial distance information.

1. **Exchange Information Phase:**
   Routers periodically exchange their routing tables with their immediate neighbors. For instance, router A sends its routing table to neighbors B and C. Router B sends its table to A and D, and so on.

2. **Update Phase:**
   Upon receiving the routing tables from their neighbors, routers update their own routing tables by considering the information from the neighbors.

   Let's say Router A receives updated information from Router B that the distance to Router D is 2 units via Router B. Router A would then update its own table to reflect this new information.

3. **Calculate Best Routes:**
   Routers recalculate their routes based on the updated information. If they find shorter paths to certain destinations, they update their routing tables accordingly.

   For example, Router A previously thought it would take 3 units to reach Router D via Router C. But now, based on the information from Router B, it realizes that the path through Router B is shorter (2 units), so it updates its table to reflect this change.

4. **Repeat Process:**
   This process of exchanging information, updating tables, and recalculating routes continues iteratively. Routers keep updating their tables until no significant changes occur.

5. **Convergence:**
   Over time, the routing tables of all routers converge to stable values, and they all have consistent information about the best paths to reach each destination.

It's important to note that Distance Vector Routing has some limitations, such as the "count-to-infinity" problem, where incorrect distance information takes time to propagate and stabilize. Despite these limitations, Distance Vector Routing algorithms, like the Routing Information Protocol (RIP), have been widely used in simpler network setups due to their simplicity and ease of implementation. More complex networks often use link-state algorithms like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) to overcome the limitations of distance vector routing.


Example:   
Consider the following network topology:

```
       A
     /   \
    1     3
   /       \
  B----2----C
   \       /
    1     2
     \   /
       D
```

In this diagram, the letters A, B, C, and D represent routers, and the numbers on the links represent the distances (or costs) between the routers. For instance, the link between A and B has a cost of 1, and the link between B and C has a cost of 2.

Initial setup:
- Router A knows that it is directly connected to routers B and C with distances 1 and 3, respectively.
- Router B knows that it is directly connected to routers A, C, and D with distances 1, 2, and 1, respectively.
- Router C knows that it is directly connected to routers A, B, and D with distances 3, 2, and 2, respectively.
- Router D knows that it is directly connected to routers B and C with distances 1 and 2, respectively.

1. **Exchange Information Phase:**
   - Router A shares its table with neighbors B and C.
   - Router B shares its table with neighbors A, C, and D.
   - Router C shares its table with neighbors A, B, and D.
   - Router D shares its table with neighbors B and C.

2. **Update Phase:**
   - Based on the received information, routers update their own tables.

   For example, let's say Router A receives updated information from Router B that the distance to Router D is 3 units via Router B. Router A would update its own table to reflect this new information.

3. **Calculate Best Routes:**
   - Routers recalculate their routes based on the updated information.

   Suppose Router A initially thought it would take 4 units to reach Router D via Router C. But now, based on the updated information from Router B, it realizes that the path through Router B is shorter (3 units), so it updates its table accordingly.

4. **Repeat Process:**
   - Routers continue to exchange information, update their tables, and recalculate routes iteratively.

5. **Convergence:**
   - Over time, the routing tables of all routers converge to stable values.

By repeating these steps, the routing tables for each router will eventually stabilize, and they will have consistent information about the best paths to reach each destination.

For instance, after convergence:
- Router A knows that the best path to reach Router D is via Router B with a total cost of 2 units.
- Router B knows that the best path to reach Router D is directly with a cost of 1 unit.

This example demonstrates the iterative process of Distance Vector Routing, where routers exchange information to determine the best paths to reach destinations in the network.

The updating phase uses the below method: 

```
x----y
     \
      \
       \
        z
```
d(x,z) => Current distance from x to z 

Now when it reccieves the DV table from B
```
d(x,z) = min (d(x,z), d(x,y)+ d(y,z));
```
the idea is to calculate the cost of intial node to intermediate node or whose DV is recieved and then check its distance to the destination, add them up and see if it is less than the current dv.

RIP(Routing Information Protocol) was implemented using DISTANCE VECTOR ALGORITHM.
