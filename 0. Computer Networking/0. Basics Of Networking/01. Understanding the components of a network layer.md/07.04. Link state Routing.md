# Link state Routing
Explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW6zV-040SY

Link-state routing is a routing algorithm used in computer networks where each router independently determines its own shortest path to all other routers in the network. Unlike distance vector routing, which focuses on exchanging routing information, link-state routing focuses on distributing information about the state of individual links in the network. This information is then used to construct a detailed network map, allowing each router to calculate its optimal routes based on that map.

Here's an explanation of link-state routing with an example and diagram:

Consider a network topology with five routers: A, B, C, D, and E. The following diagram illustrates the connections and link costs:

```
      1      2
A --------- B ------- C
|\                   /|
| \    3      1     / |
|  \----- D -----  /  |
|   \             /   |
|    \    2      /    |
E -----\--------/---- F
      1      1

```

1. **Initial Setup:**
   Each router knows its own directly connected neighbors and the link costs to reach them.

2. **Link-State Advertisement:**
   Each router creates a "link-state advertisement," which includes information about its own identity, its directly connected neighbors, and the costs of the links to those neighbors. This advertisement is then flooded throughout the network to reach all other routers.

3. **Building the Link-State Database:**
   Each router collects the link-state advertisements from all other routers in the network. With this information, routers build a comprehensive "link-state database," which contains the entire network's topology and link costs.

4. **Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm:**
   Using the link-state database, each router runs Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path to all other routers. Dijkstra's algorithm determines the minimum cost paths from the router to all other routers based on the link costs.

5. **Calculating Routes:**
   With the shortest path information available, each router can calculate the best next-hop router to reach any destination in the network. This leads to the creation of the router's routing table, which contains the optimal paths to each destination.

6. **Updating Link-State Information:**
   If a link fails or a new link is added to the network, the affected router updates its link-state information and generates a new link-state advertisement. This updated advertisement is then flooded throughout the network, and routers adjust their link-state databases and recalculates routes accordingly.

In the provided example, let's say Router A generates a link-state advertisement indicating its neighbors (B, D, E) and their link costs. This advertisement is sent to all other routers. Similarly, each router does the same, leading to a network-wide collection of link-state advertisements.

Using these advertisements, routers construct the link-state database and run Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest paths. For instance, Router A learns that to reach Router F, it should go through routers B and C, with a total cost of 4.

Link-state routing is more robust and converges faster than distance vector routing because it relies on a detailed understanding of the network's topology. However, it requires more memory and processing power to maintain and distribute the link-state advertisements and databases.


## Calcultaions in while Dijikstra Algorithm

Let's walk through the steps of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths in the given network topology:

```
      1      2
A --------- B --------- C
|\                   /|
| \    3      1    / |
|  \----- D -----/  |
|   \             /  |
|    \    2      /   |
E -----\--------/---- F
      1      1
```

We'll calculate the shortest paths from Router A to all other routers.

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set the initial distance values for all routers to infinity except for Router A (source node), which is set to 0.
   - Create a set of unvisited nodes, initially containing all routers.

   | Node | Distance from A | Previous Node |
   |------|-----------------|---------------|
   | A    | 0               | None          |
   | B    | ∞               | None          |
   | C    | ∞               | None          |
   | D    | ∞               | None          |
   | E    | ∞               | None          |
   | F    | ∞               | None          |

2. **Iteration 1:**
   - Choose the node with the smallest distance from the unvisited set. In this case, it's A (distance = 0).
   - Update the distances for A's neighbors (B, E) by considering the cost of the links.

   | Node | Distance from A | Previous Node |
   |------|-----------------|---------------|
   | A    | 0               | None          |

   | A    | 0               | None          |
   | B    | 1               | A             |
   | C    | 2               | B             |
   | D    | 3               | E             |
   | E    | 1               | A             |
   | F    | 3               | C             |

6. **Iteration 5:**
   - Choose the node with the smallest distance from the unvisited set. In this case, it's D (distance = 3).
   - Update the distances for D's neighbors (B, C, E, F) by considering the cost of the links.

   | Node | Distance from A | Previous Node |

   | B    | 1               | A             |
   | C    | 2               | B             |
   | D    | 3               | E             |
   | E    | 1               | A             |
   | F    | 3               | C             |

7. **Iteration 6:**
   - Choose the node with the smallest distance from the unvisited set. In this case, it's F (distance = 3).
   - Update the distances for F's neighbors (C, D) by considering the cost of the links.

   | Node | Distance from A | Previous Node |

   | E    | 1               | A             |
   | F    | 3               | C             |

8. **Shortest Paths:**
   Using the calculated distances and previous nodes, we can determine the shortest paths from Router A to all other routers:

   - Shortest path to B: A -> B (Cost = 1)
   - Shortest path to C: A -> B -> C (Cost = 1 + 1 = 2)
   - Shortest path to D: A -> E -> D (Cost = 1 + 2 = 3)
   - Shortest path to E: A -> E (Cost = 1)
   - Shortest path to F: A -> B -> C -> F (Cost = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3)

Dijkstra's algorithm helps find the shortest paths in the network, considering link costs between routers. The distances calculated in each iteration reflect the minimum cost to reach each router from Router A.
