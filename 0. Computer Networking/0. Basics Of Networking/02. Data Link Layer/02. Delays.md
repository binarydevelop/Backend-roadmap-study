# Delays

## Transmission Delay 
Time taken by the sender to put a data packet on the channel is known as Transmission Delay. 
It depends upon:
1. Link Bandwidth
2. Packet Length
Ex: Link Bandwidth = 100bits/sec
    packet length = 1000bits

    Td= pl/lb

## Propogation Delay 
Time taken for the last bit to reach the destination point. 

pd = distance/velocity
