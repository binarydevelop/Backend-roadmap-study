# Stop and Wait ARQ

Stop-and-Wait ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest) is a simple protocol used in communication systems to ensure reliable data transmission between a sender and a receiver. It's a form of error control mechanism that uses acknowledgments (ACKs) and negative acknowledgments (NAKs) to manage the flow of data and handle potential errors.

Here's an explanation of the Stop-and-Wait ARQ protocol:

**Protocol Overview:**

1. **Sender Side:**
   - The sender divides the data into smaller frames or packets before transmitting.
   - The sender sends a frame to the receiver and waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) or a negative acknowledgment (NAK) from the receiver.
   - If an ACK is received, the sender assumes that the frame was successfully received and moves on to send the next frame.
   - If a NAK is received or if a timeout occurs without any response, the sender assumes that the frame was lost or corrupted and retransmits the same frame.

2. **Receiver Side:**
   - The receiver receives a frame from the sender.
   - If the frame is error-free, the receiver sends an ACK back to the sender, indicating successful reception.
   - If the frame has errors, the receiver sends a NAK or doesn't send any response, indicating that the sender should retransmit the frame.

**Diagrams:**

Let's consider a scenario with labeled steps and diagrams to illustrate the Stop-and-Wait ARQ process:

**Step 1: Sender sends Frame 1**

```
Sender                          Receiver
 |                                 |
 |--------[ Frame 1 ]------------->|
 |                                 |
```

**Step 2: Receiver responds with ACK for Frame 1**

```
Sender                          Receiver
 |                                 |
 |<-------[   ACK   ]--------------|
 |                                 |
```

**Step 3: Sender sends Frame 2**

```
Sender                          Receiver
 |                                 |
 |--------[ Frame 2 ]------------->|
 |                                 |
```

**Step 4: Receiver detects an error in Frame 2 and responds with NAK**

```
Sender                          Receiver
 |                                 |
 |<-------[   NAK   ]--------------|
 |                                 |
```

**Step 5: Sender retransmits Frame 2**

```
Sender                          Receiver
 |                                 |
 |--------[ Frame 2 ]------------->|
 |                                 |
```

**Step 6: Receiver receives Frame 2 correctly and responds with ACK**

```
Sender                          Receiver
 |                                 |
 |<-------[   ACK   ]--------------|
 |                                 |
```

This process continues for subsequent frames. The sender waits for an acknowledgment before sending the next frame and retransmits frames that result in NAKs or timeouts.

Please note that this protocol is quite simple and can be inefficient in scenarios where the communication channel has a high error rate or significant delays. More advanced protocols, such as Go-Back-N ARQ and Selective Repeat ARQ, are used to improve efficiency and throughput in such situations.

Sequence numbers are used in ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest) protocols, including the Stop-and-Wait ARQ, to uniquely identify the frames being sent and received. They help in ensuring the correct order of frames, detecting and handling duplicates, and providing a mechanism for both the sender and receiver to keep track of the progress of the communication. Here's how sequence numbers are used in the context of Stop-and-Wait ARQ:

**Sender Side:**
1. **Frame Numbering:** Each frame that the sender sends is assigned a sequence number. Typically, the sequence numbers alternate between two values, such as 0 and 1. This ensures that the sender can differentiate between successive frames.

2. **Sending a Frame:** When the sender sends a frame, it attaches the sequence number to that frame. This sequence number acts as an identifier for that specific frame.

3. **Waiting for ACK:** After sending a frame, the sender enters a "wait for acknowledgment" state. It will not send the next frame until it receives an acknowledgment (ACK) or a negative acknowledgment (NAK) from the receiver.

**Receiver Side:**
1. **Frame Identification:** When the receiver receives a frame, it looks at the attached sequence number. This allows the receiver to identify the order of the received frames and to detect any missing or duplicate frames.

2. **Sending ACK or NAK:** If the received frame is error-free and in the expected sequence, the receiver sends an ACK back to the sender. If the received frame has errors or is out of sequence, the receiver sends a NAK or discards the frame without sending an ACK.

3. **Handling Duplicates:** If the receiver receives a frame with a sequence number it has already received and acknowledged, it is treated as a duplicate and discarded. This ensures that frames are not processed more than once.

**Example:**
Let's illustrate the usage of sequence numbers in Stop-and-Wait ARQ:

1. Sender sends Frame 0 with sequence number 0.

```
Sender                          Receiver
 |                                 |
 |--------[ Frame 0 ]------------->|
 |                                 |
```

2. Receiver receives Frame 0 and sends an ACK.

```
Sender                          Receiver
 |<-------[   ACK   ]--------------|
 |                                 |
```

3. Sender sends Frame 1 with sequence number 1.

```
Sender                          Receiver
 |                                 |
 |--------[ Frame 1 ]------------->|
 |                                 |
```

4. Receiver receives Frame 1 and sends an ACK.

```
Sender                          Receiver
 |<-------[   ACK   ]--------------|
 |                                 |
```

The sequence numbers (0 and 1) help the receiver distinguish between the two frames and allow the sender to ensure proper sequencing and wait for acknowledgments before sending the next frame.

In summary, sequence numbers play a crucial role in maintaining the order, detecting errors, and managing the flow of frames in Stop-and-Wait ARQ and other ARQ protocols.


## Working

1) Sender A sends a data frame or packet with sequence number 0. 
2) Receiver B, after receiving the data frame, sends an acknowledgement with sequence number 1 (the sequence number of the next expected data frame or packet) 
There is only a one-bit sequence number that implies that both sender and receiver have a buffer for one frame or packet only.
