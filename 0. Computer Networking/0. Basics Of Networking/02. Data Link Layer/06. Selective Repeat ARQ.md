# Selective Repeat ARQ 

The Selective Repeat Protocol is a variation of the Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) protocol used in data communication networks to ensure reliable data transmission over unreliable channels, such as wireless or noisy communication links. It's specifically employed in the data link layer to manage the flow of data between a sender and a receiver.

The main idea behind the Selective Repeat Protocol is to allow the receiver to acknowledge individual frames (packets) within a larger window of frames that the sender is allowed to transmit before waiting for acknowledgments. This approach improves efficiency by allowing the sender to continue sending data without waiting for acknowledgments for all transmitted frames.

Here's how the Selective Repeat Protocol works:

1. **Sender Side:**
   - The sender maintains a window of frames it's allowed to send without waiting for acknowledgments. This window contains both frames that have been sent but not yet acknowledged and frames that can be sent.
   - The sender sends multiple frames within the window and continues sending additional frames as long as there's room in the window.

2. **Receiver Side:**
   - The receiver maintains a window of frames it's expecting to receive. This window corresponds to the sender's window and may include frames that have not yet been received.
   - When a frame arrives at the receiver, it checks if it's within the receiver's window. If it is, the receiver sends an acknowledgment for that specific frame.

3. **Acknowledgments and Timeouts:**
   - The sender doesn't wait for acknowledgments for all frames. Instead, it waits for acknowledgments only for the frames that are within the receiver's window.
   - The sender sets a timer for each sent frame that expects an acknowledgment. If the timer expires before an acknowledgment is received, the sender assumes the frame was lost and retransmits it.

4. **Handling Out-of-Order Frames:**
   - If a frame is received out of order but falls within the receiver's window, it's buffered. Once the missing frame(s) arrive, the receiver can deliver all buffered frames to the higher layers in the correct order.

5. **Efficiency and Advantages:**
   - Selective Repeat improves efficiency compared to Stop-and-Wait or Go-Back-N protocols because the sender can continue transmitting even if some frames are lost.
   - It minimizes the retransmission of frames since only lost or corrupted frames need to be resent, instead of retransmitting a whole window.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The Selective Repeat Protocol is more complex to implement than Go-Back-N due to the need for individual acknowledgments and buffer management at both the sender and receiver sides.

In summary, the Selective Repeat Protocol offers a balance between the efficiency of Go-Back-N and the reliability of Stop-and-Wait. It allows the sender to transmit multiple frames before waiting for acknowledgments and enables the receiver to selectively acknowledge and buffer out-of-order frames. This approach helps optimize data transmission in network communication while ensuring reliable delivery of data.

## Example

**Scenario:**
Suppose we have a sender (S) and a receiver (R) connected by an unreliable communication channel. The sender wants to transmit a series of frames (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5) to the receiver.

**Assumptions:**
- The sender's window size (maximum number of unacknowledged frames) is 3.
- The receiver's window size (maximum number of expected frames) is also 3.

Here's how the communication would look step by step:

**Step 1: Initial State**
```
Sender Window: [F1, F2, F3]
Receiver Window: [F1, F2, F3]
```

The sender starts by sending the first three frames (F1, F2, F3). The receiver's window indicates the expected frames.

**Step 2: Frames Arrive at Receiver**
```
Sender Window: [F1, F2, F3]
Receiver Window: [F1, F2, F3]
```

All three frames (F1, F2, F3) arrive at the receiver. The receiver acknowledges these frames and updates its window.

**Step 3: Frames 1 and 2 Acknowledged at Sender**
```
Sender Window: [F1, F2, F3]
Receiver Window: [F1, F2, F3]
```

The receiver acknowledges the receipt of frames F1 and F2. The sender updates its window and can now transmit the next frame (F4).

**Step 4: Frame F4 Sent by Sender**
```
Sender Window: [F4, F2, F3]
Receiver Window: [F1, F2, F3]
```

The sender transmits frame F4 while still waiting for an acknowledgment for frame F3.

**Step 5: Receiver Receives Frame F4**
```
Sender Window: [F4, F2, F3]
Receiver Window: [F1, F2, F3]
```

The receiver receives frame F4 but cannot acknowledge it yet because it's still waiting for frame F3.

**Step 6: Frame F3 Acknowledged at Receiver**
```
Sender Window: [F4, F2, F3]
Receiver Window: [F4, F2, F3]
```

The receiver finally receives frame F3, acknowledges it, and updates its window. Now, frame F4 can be acknowledged at the receiver as well.

**Step 7: Frames 2 and 3 Acknowledged at Sender**
```
Sender Window: [F4, F5, -]
Receiver Window: [F4, F2, F3]
```

The receiver acknowledges frames F2 and F3, allowing the sender to advance its window and send the next frame (F5).

**Step 8: Frame F5 Sent and Received**
```
Sender Window: [F4, F5, -]
Receiver Window: [F4, F2, F3]
```

The sender transmits frame F5, and the receiver receives it.

**Step 9: Frames F2 and F3 Acknowledged at Receiver**
```
Sender Window: [F4, F5, -]
Receiver Window: [F5, -, -]
```

The receiver acknowledges frames F2 and F3. Since its window size is 3, it can only acknowledge frame F5.

**Step 10: Frame F4 Acknowledged at Receiver**
```
Sender Window: [F4, F5, -]
Receiver Window: [F5, F4, -]
```

The receiver acknowledges frame F4. Both frames F4 and F5 are now acknowledged.

This example demonstrates the selective acknowledgment process in the Selective Repeat Protocol. The sender and receiver maintain their windows to control the flow of frames, and acknowledgments are sent for individual frames within the window. This approach allows the sender to continue transmitting even if not all frames have been acknowledged, improving the efficiency of data transmission.
