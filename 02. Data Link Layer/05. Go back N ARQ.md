# Go back N ARQ

"Go-Back-N ARQ" (Automatic Repeat reQuest) is an error-control protocol used in data communication to ensure reliable delivery of frames from sender to receiver. In Go-Back-N ARQ, the sender is allowed to transmit a sequence of frames without waiting for individual acknowledgments for each frame. The receiver acknowledges correctly received frames cumulatively, meaning it acknowledges all frames up to a certain point.

Here's an explanation of Go-Back-N ARQ with diagrams covering different cases:

**Protocol Overview:**
1. Sender maintains a "window" of frames that can be sent without waiting for acknowledgments.
2. The receiver acknowledges the receipt of all frames up to a specific point.
3. If an acknowledgment is not received within a certain time (timeout), the sender assumes a frame was lost and retransmits all unacknowledged frames in the window.

**Diagram:**
Let's illustrate Go-Back-N ARQ with a sender and receiver communicating over a network:

**Scenario 1: Normal Transmission**
```
Sender                          Receiver
 |                                 |
 |----[ Frame 0 ]----------------->|
 |----[ Frame 1 ]----------------->|
 |----[ Frame 2 ]----------------->|
 |<-------[   ACK   ]--------------|
 |<-------[   ACK   ]--------------|
 |<-------[   ACK   ]--------------|
 |                                 |
```

In this scenario, the sender sends frames 0, 1, and 2, and the receiver acknowledges them individually. All frames are successfully received.

**Scenario 2: Frame Loss**
```
Sender                          Receiver
 |                                 |
 |----[ Frame 0 ]----------------->|
 |----[ Frame 1 ]----------------->|
 |----[ Frame 2 ]----------------->|
 |                                 |
 |                                 |
 |                                 |
 |<-------[   NAK   ]--------------|
 |                                 |
 |----[ Frame 0 ]----------------->|
 |----[ Frame 1 ]----------------->|
 |----[ Frame 2 ]----------------->|
 |<-------[   ACK   ]--------------|
 |<-------[   ACK   ]--------------|
 |<-------[   ACK   ]--------------|
 |                                 |
```

In this scenario, the receiver detects an error in frame 2 (loss). It sends a Negative Acknowledgment (NAK) requesting retransmission. The sender then retransmits all frames in the window, starting from the lost frame (Go-Back-N).

**Scenario 3: ACK Loss**
```
Sender                          Receiver
 |                                 |
 |----[ Frame 0 ]----------------->|
 |----[ Frame 1 ]----------------->|
 |----[ Frame 2 ]----------------->|
 |<-------[   ACK   ]--------------|
 |                                 |
 |                                 |
 |                                 |
 |                                 |
 |                                 |
 |                                 |
 |                                 |
 |----[ Frame 0 ]----------------->|
 |----[ Frame 1 ]----------------->|
 |----[ Frame 2 ]----------------->|
 |<-------[   ACK   ]--------------|
 |<-------[   ACK   ]--------------|
 |<-------[   ACK   ]--------------|
 |                                 |
```

In this scenario, an acknowledgment is lost. The sender does not receive the acknowledgments for frames 0, 1, and 2. Since it's a cumulative acknowledgment, the receiver acknowledges frames up to 2 upon receiving the acknowledgment for frame 0. The sender doesn't know whether frame 1 and 2 were received or not. It retransmits all frames in the window.

Please note that Go-Back-N ARQ can be inefficient in situations where multiple frames are lost, as it may lead to unnecessary retransmissions. More advanced protocols like Selective Repeat ARQ address this limitation by allowing the receiver to acknowledge individual frames.
