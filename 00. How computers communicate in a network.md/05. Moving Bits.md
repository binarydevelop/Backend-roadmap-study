# Moving Bits

The physical layer consist devices and means of transmitting data across computer networks. 

A bit is smallest unit of data that a computer can understand. It's a one or a zero. 
These 1's and 0's sent across networks at the lowest level are what makes packets of data. 

A standard network computer cable once connected to devices on both ends will carry a constant electrical charge. 1's and 0's are sent through these network through a process called Modulation.

Modulation is a way of varying the voltage of this charge moving across the cable. When used for computer networks these encoding are specifically known as line encoding. It allows devices on either end of the link to understand that an electrical charge in a certain state is 0 or 1.
