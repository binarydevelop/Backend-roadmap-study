# Dissescting an Ethernet Frame
Data Packet : An all-encompassing term that represents any single set of binary data being sent across a network link.
Data packets at ethernet level are known as ethernet frame. Ethernet Frame is a highly structured collection of information presented in a specific order. 

This way network interfaces at physcial layer can convert a stream of bits travelling across a link into meaningful data.

The first part of ethernet frame is known as preamble. 
A preamble is 8 bytes or 64 bits long and can itself be split into two sections. The first 7 bytes are alternating of 1's and 0's
These act as a buffer between frames and can also be used by network interfaces to synchronize internal clocks to regulate the speed at which they send data.  
The last byte is known SFD or start Frame delimiter signals to a recieving device that the preamble is over and that the actual frame contents will now follow. 

Then comes the destination MAC address. The hardware address of the inteded recipent and then followed by the source MAC address.

The next one is called the Ether Type field. It's 16 bit long and used to describe the protocol of the contents of the frame. Sometimes we can also find something called as VLAN header which indicates that the frame itself is what's called a VLAN frame. 
If a VLAN header is present the entherType field follows it. 

VLAN stands for virtual lan, it's a technique that lets you have multiple logical LANS operating on the same physcial equipment. 

After that is the networking payload. In networking paylod is the actual data being transported which is everything that isn't header. It contains info from all upper layers such as IP transport and applicaion. Following that is a FCS Frame Check sequence, it is a 4 byte number that represents a checksum value for the entire frame. This checksum value is calculated by performing whats known as a cyclical redundancy check against the frame. 

CRC is an important concept for data integrity and is used all over computing not just network transmissions.
